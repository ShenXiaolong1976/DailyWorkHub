# purpose
Integrate all launch entries in one page, one-click to open any local application , local script, local file and remote url in browser page , instead of downloading them.
### because of security limitation , browser can't run any `local` application/script from a web link by default .
Here use a protocol way to resolve this requirement.  
with this workhub, you can load any your local application / script with your customized parameter on your local windows system from a web link clicking, instead of downloading them.

# feature
it is used to load local application and script from a web link to improve daily work productivity.  
the full script suite includes `.js file` , `.css file` , `xiaolong's chrome extension` , `subcommand interpreter (batch script)`. it will generate below content automatically.
- page header info, used for quick edit and open general tools.
- embed css style , auto-dark mode.
- for all remote link , add `targe="_blank"` attribute to open it in new tab.
- for local .txt file path, add edit link (@) and directory browse link to quick edit it and browse its folder.   
  see https://github.com/shenxiaolong-code/DailyWorkHub/blob/main/usage_demo/entry_main_page.png
- trim blank chars in a link text.
- detect empty link text and add it automatically. e.g. you can use the below HTML content legally and directly.  
  ```<a href="C:\temp\DailyWorkHub\localAppLoader.bat"> </a>```   
  it will use the href value as its link text.
- for any html tag which has ``localurl`` attribute, generate two children elements : file link and directory link.  
  e.g. ```<div localurl="C:\temp\DailyWorkHub\localAppLoader.bat"><div>```

By click the link , you can do :
- open your local folder, instead of listing its folder content.
- open/edit a local file by your expected application directly, instead of popuping a downloading message box to confirm download.
- run a local script/application with parameter or from your clipboard data.
- connect remote linux folder via local vscode directly.
- connect remote server via ssh protocol directly.
- open remote linux folder via winscp directly.
- connect remote linux server via vnc directly without vnc viewer.
- connect remote windows desktop via windows RDP services directly without manual interaction.

# Usage
you need to do:
1. update the **localAppLoader.bat path** to your real local path in **localAppLoader_install.reg**
2. double-click file **localAppLoader_install.reg** to import it into your register.
   and ***verify*** it is imported sucessfully because some branches can't be imported successful, it needs your manual importing.
3. run the test file **test_install/localAppLoader_test.bat** or **test_install/localAppLoader_test.html**
   if test it with localAppLoader_test.html, to **click one link, one message will popup -- it is sucessfully**.
4. update the localAppLoader.bat based on your daily work business.
   the original localAppLoader.bat is my work hub script -- its nested/called script lies in the repo WinScript -- you can find them in my repo list.
